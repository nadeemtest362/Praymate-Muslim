## Proven Hook Formulas

### Formula 1: The Transformation Story

**Template:** "I used to [negative state], but then [God/Jesus/faith] [specific change]"

**Why it works:**

- Personal vulnerability creates connection
- Before/after structure is compelling
- Specific details make it believable

**Examples:**

- "I used to party every weekend, but then God showed me real joy"
- "I used to cut myself, but then Jesus healed my broken heart"
- "I used to mock Christians, but then I experienced a miracle"

### Formula 2: The Controversial Question

**Template:** "Why do Christians [seemingly contradictory behavior]?"

**Why it works:**

- Creates curiosity gap
- Challenges assumptions
- Invites both believers and skeptics

**Examples:**

- "Why do Christians celebrate when bad things happen?"
- "Why do Christians say they're free but follow so many rules?"
- "Why do Christians claim to love everyone but judge so much?"

### Formula 3: The Hidden Truth

**Template:** "What [they/nobody/your pastor] doesn't tell you about [topic]"

**Why it works:**

- Promise of insider information
- Suggests mainstream Christianity is missing something
- Creates FOMO (fear of missing out)

**Examples:**

- "What your pastor doesn't tell you about depression"
- "What nobody talks about when you're waiting on God"
- "What they don't tell you about being a Christian in college"

### Formula 4: The Challenge

**Template:** "I dare you to [specific action] for [specific timeframe] and see what happens"

**Why it works:**

- Clear call to action
- Time-bound creates urgency
- "See what happens" creates curiosity

**Examples:**

- "I dare you to thank God for 3 things every morning for a week"
- "I dare you to pray for your haters for 30 days and see what happens"
- "I dare you to read one Bible verse before checking social media"

## Remember

The data shows that authenticity beats perfection every time. The most viral Christian content isn't the most polished - it's the most real. Users want to see genuine transformation, honest struggles, and practical faith in action.

Focus on creating hooks that:

- Tell real stories
- Ask hard questions
- Share unexpected truths
- Challenge people to action

And always remember: **The first 3 seconds determine everything.**
